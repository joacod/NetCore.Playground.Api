## Notes
The idea of this project is to provide all the apis that exists in my other repository [go-playground-api](https://github.com/joacod/go-playground-api)

What we get from this:
- We practice different approaches in .NetCore
- We can compare **.NET Core** implementations with the same ones written in **Go**
- We have two versions of the same Web Api written in different languages, that can be switched from a UI having the exact same results

I have created three UI projects to consume the APIs created here, you can use either of the following repositories:
- [Angular Playground](https://github.com/joacod/angular-playground-ui)
- [Vue Playground](https://github.com/joacod/vue-playground-ui)
- [React Playground](https://github.com/joacod/react-playground-ui)

## What you will find so far :heavy_check_mark:
- [x] Web API created with .NET Core
- [x] Swagger documentation of the APIs usign [Swashbuckle](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore/)
